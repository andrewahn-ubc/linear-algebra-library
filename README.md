# Linear Algebra Library
This is my love letter to linear algebra... Also I wanted to shake the dust off of my C++ skills
<br />
<br />
MVP Features:
- [ ] basic +-x/ operations between tensors and a constant
- [ ] element-wise +-xl operations between tensors of the same shape
- [ ] matrix multiplication for 2d and 1d tensors (includes dot products between 1d tensors)
- [ ] solutions to Ax = b (using Gaussian Elimination)

Stretch Goals:
- [ ] Basic broadcasting
- [ ] Parallelization via multithreading
- [ ] Handle numerical instability (eg. pivoting for LU, compensated summation algorithms to mitigate cancellation error, etc.)
- [ ] Other linear algebra tools (LU & QR decomposition, inverses, transposes, determinant, eigenvalues, etc.)
